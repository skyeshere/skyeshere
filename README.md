Hey I'm eilidh, or skye, (she/her) and I'm a 4th year undergraduate computing science student.
Kinda bare bones atm but I PROMISE I'll have more things here that aren't just assignments :D

Projects will primarily be done in Java as that is what my university chooses to teach in, and the practice of concepts taught is important.
Although, there might be some Python or C for other things as well.
