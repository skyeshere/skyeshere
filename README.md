Hey I'm Skye (she/they) and I'm an undergraduate computing science student at the University of Stirling and currently in my 3rd year!
Kinda bare bones atm but I PROMISE I'll have more things here that aren't just assignments :D

Projects will primarily be done in Java as that is what my university chooses to teach in, and the practice of concepts taught is important.
Although, there might be some Python for ML based assignments as well.
